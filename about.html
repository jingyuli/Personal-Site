                <p>I am a third year student studying electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. I was born in Beijing, China and grew up in Wyoming. I can speak English and Mandarin fluently. I have experience in artificial intelligence, including machine learning, deep learning, machine vision, and natural language processing. I am also familiar with TensorFlow, OpenCV, Linux, Java, Python, C/C++, MATLAB/Octave, HTML, CSS, LaTeX, and Photoshop. </p>
                <p>The areas of artificial intelligence, human technology interaction, medical technology, photography, and design particularly pique my interest.</p>

                <p>I spend most of my spare time taking and editing pictures. When I get the occasional motivation, I paint and draw a little. My other hobbies include playing pool, ping-pong, tennis, board games, and just chilling with friends and family. </p><p>I recently got involved with ice skating and skate occasionally with the MIT Figure Skating Club. This summer, I learned how to cook some basic food (scrambled eggs and spinach!).</p><p>In terms of music, I really enjoy listening to Mariah Carey, Ariana Grande, Jojo, and Tori Kelly and singing along when no one's listening. My favorite TV show is Friends (I refuse to finish it because once I'm finished it'll be all over D:). </p><p>In the future, I'd ideally have the chance to travel the world and take pictures everywhere.</p>
